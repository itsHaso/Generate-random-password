# Generate-random-password

## I Created this to dip into javaScript for the first time really tried to use some of te concepts and ideas that we learned in class and outside of class to use in this project.

## I was able to put use some of those concepts in use here like a FOR loop and if statements.

### To use the application you just open it up in a browser and click the generate button then it will give you some prompts asking how long you want the password to be it has to be between 8-128 characters no more no less, then it asks if you want uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, or special characters in the password and then it should spit out a password based on the criteria you input.
